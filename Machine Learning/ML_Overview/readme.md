# Machine Learning – Overview

## 1. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing fixed rules, ML algorithms learn rules automatically from historical data.

---

## 2. Why Machine Learning?
Traditional programming fails when:
- Rules are complex or unknown
- Data is huge and dynamic
- Patterns change over time

Machine Learning is used to:
- Automate decision-making
- Predict future outcomes
- Discover hidden patterns

## 3. Machine Learning vs AI vs Deep Learning

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
  Broad field focused on making machines intelligent.

- **Machine Learning (ML):**
  Subset of AI where machines learn from data.

- **Deep Learning (DL):**
  Subset of ML using neural networks with many layers.

Relationship:
AI ⟶ ML ⟶ DL

## 4. Types of Machine Learning

### 4.1 Supervised Learning
- Data is labeled
- Model learns input → output mapping

Examples:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- SVM

Use cases:
- Price prediction
- Spam detection
- Disease diagnosis

---

### 4.2 Unsupervised Learning
- No labels
- Model finds structure in data

Examples:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- PCA

Use cases:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Dimensionality reduction

---

### 4.3 Semi-Supervised Learning
- Small labeled data + large unlabeled data
- Used when labeling is expensive

---

### 4.4 Reinforcement Learning
- Agent learns by interacting with environment
- Uses reward & penalty mechanism

Examples:
- Game AI
- Robotics
- Self-driving cars

- **Model:** Mathematical representation
- **Training:** Learning from data
- **Inference:** Making predictions
- **Overfitting:** Model memorizes data

---

## 7. Batch Learning vs Online Learning

- **Batch Learning:**  
  Model trained on entire dataset at once

- **Online Learning:**  
  Model learns continuously from new data

---

## 8. Parametric vs Non-Parametric Models

- **Parametric:**  
  Fixed number of parameters (Linear Regression)

- **Non-Parametric:**  
  Flexible, data-driven (KNN, Decision Trees)

---
